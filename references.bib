  abstract = "A partial automorphism of a combinatorial structure is an isomorphism between its two induced substructures. It is a natural generalization of a total automorphism which is a classical tool to study symmetries. As all total automorphisms of a combinatorial structure form a group, all partial automorphisms form an inverse monoid, called inverse monoid of partial automorphisms of a combinatorial structure. This monoid is a richer and more complex object that contains more information about the structure than its automorphism group used in the classical Group Theory. In our paper, we review the results we obtained for the inverse monoids of partial automorphisms of graphs in the study of questions analogous to those concerning automorphism groups of graphs. We also address some computational aspects of finding these inverse monoids."

abstract = {We present a novel learning-based approach to graph representations of road networks employing state-of-the-art graph convolutional neural networks. Our approach is applied to realistic road networks of 17 cities from Open Street Map. While edge features are crucial to generate descriptive graph representations of road networks, graph convolutional networks usually rely on node features only. We show that the highly representative edge features can still be integrated into such networks by applying a line graph transformation. We also propose a method for neighborhood sampling based on a topological neighborhood composed of both local and global neighbors. We compare the performance of learning representations using different types of neighborhood aggregation functions in transductive and inductive tasks and in supervised and unsupervised learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel aggregation approach, Graph Attention Isomorphism Network, GAIN1. Our results show that GAIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the road type classification problem.}

abstract = {This paper presents a largely improved version of the VF2 algorithm for the Subgraph Isomorphism Problem. The improvements are twofold. Firstly, it is based on a new approach for determining the matching order of the nodes, and secondly, more efficient — nevertheless easier to compute — cutting rules are proposed. They together reduce the search space significantly. In addition to the usual Subgraph Isomorphism Problem, the paper also presents specialized algorithms for the Induced Subgraph Isomorphism and for the Graph Isomorphism Problems. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation is provided using a wide range of inputs, including both real-life biological and chemical datasets and standard randomly generated graph series. The results show major and consistent running time improvements over the other known methods. The C++ implementations of the algorithms are available open-source as part of the LEMON graph and network optimization library.}

In this paper, class tree is proposed based on the node to delete the exact graph isomorphism problem, you can quickly determine the graph isomorphism problem, and theoretical analysis and experiments show that the algorithm can determine the class in polynomial time tree isomorphism problem.}
